# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> One component or file can receive information or properties from another "parent" element. For example, text styles in a div would be inherited by each text element within that div, or a vue component receiving props from a page it's embedded in.

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> The singleton pattern uses single instances of a class and makes it available from anywhere vs using a lot of context-specific classes.

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> The observer pattern makes decisions based on the observable data. What we've used the most is the AppState. This can also be implemented through a 2-way connection to a server, through something like sockets.

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> The strategy pattern allows us to set different paths for users based on their context.

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> The factory pattern takes advantage of commonalities between different classes to progressively build out objects as variants of the base with specific attributes added to them.

06. What is test driven development?

> Test-driven development is a way to plan ahead and write functions to meet your criteria.

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> Definition of Done. . . this is the specifics of assignment for the increment of work, like a sprint. It's the rubric to determine the success of the sprint and of each contributor.

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> • As a user, I should be able to see stats on a wrestler before I draft them.
  • As a user, I should be able to know when it's my turn to draft my team.

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> Sprint Planning Ceremony

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> During the daily scrum
