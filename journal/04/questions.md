# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > Synchronous code runs from start to finish until the code ends.
  Asynchronous code can be paused to wait for a promise to be fulfilled before it moves to the next line. Expecially useful for alerts asking the user for a response, or for receiving data from an API and formatting it into the structure of our data model.

02. What is an event listener?

  > An event listener observes the state of a given item and can call a function or method based on the listener's criteria.
  In our case, we have been watching arrays in the AppState, and acting on them based on new equivalencies being made (watches for '='), or for changes in the length of the array.
