# Intro to JavaScript
01. Which keywords are used to declare a variable in JavaScript?

    > var, let, or const, but let is preferred these days over let, and for more general use than const.

    var:
    global or function-scoped
    can be updated and redeclared within scope
    
    let:
    block-scoped
    can be updated, but not redeclared
    
    const: 
    cannot be redeclared or updated, but properties can be updated
    initialized at declarationâ€”the others can be initialized and declared separately

02. What is the definition of a function?

    > A function is a subprogram designed to perform a particular task.<br>
<i>    It is executed when called (or invoked) from elsewhere in the script, or from the HTML. Values can be included when passed and within the function.</i>
